# EVENT AGENDA.

I am dyslectic therefore i developed this library to show everyone how its like to have problems with reading comprehension.

## Installing

### Step 1. Include the library within the head.

```
<script src="dyslectionator.js"></script>
```

### Step 2. Add the selector.

```
    <!-- Container element for EventLibrary -->
    <span class="customShuffleClass">myword</span>
```

### Step 3. Initialise library.

```
  <script>
    dyslectinator.init({
      selector: ".customShuffleClass"
    });
  </script>

```

This should get you going.
